          <![CDATA[ 
          
          <p>Hello! As an IT professional, I&rsquo;ve built a diverse career managing, supporting, and optimizing on-premise systems. My experience spans roles including System Administrator, IT Consultant, Technical Support, and IT Manager across various industries such as Education, Entertainment, Advertising, Healthcare, and Insurance.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve generally worked in traditional IT environments, I&rsquo;m now excited to pivot my career towards the cloud. I&rsquo;ve been proactively developing my skills in AWS, programming, and systems architecture by working on portfolio projects and acquiring certifications to prepare for this transition. My goal is to leverage my solid IT foundation into a new role in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, Cloud Administration, or Site Reliability Engineering, where I can contribute to designing, implementing, and managing robust cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking, kettlebell workouts, and video gaming. In addition to my tech-focused career, I have a <a href="https://www.fixedmastering.com" title="small side business as an audio mastering engineer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">small side business as an audio mastering engineer</a>. This venture not only reflects my diverse interests but is also structured in a way that allows me ample time to stay committed to my primary passion - technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to exploring new opportunities in this space and contributing to the future of technology. Let&rsquo;s connect and see how we can make this happen together!</p>
